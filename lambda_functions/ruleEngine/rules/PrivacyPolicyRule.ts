 * PrivacyPolicyRule - GDPR/CCPA Compliance Violation Detection
 * 
 * This rule detects violations of privacy policy compliance requirements, specifically
 * focusing on GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer
 * Privacy Act) violations. It identifies code patterns that may violate privacy rights
 * and data protection principles.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - GDPR "Right to be forgotten" violation detection
 * - CCPA "Do not sell" violation detection
 * - Data minimization principle enforcement
 * - Consent mechanism validation
 * - Automated pattern recognition for compliance violations
 * - Legal compliance tracking and reporting
 * 
 * Detection Capabilities:
 * - Hardcoded "delete from users" queries without proper authorization
 * - Data processing without consent mechanisms
 * - Excessive data collection beyond stated purposes
 * - Missing data subject rights implementation
 * - Improper data retention practices
 * - Non-compliant data sharing patterns
 * 
 * Privacy Laws Addressed:
 * - GDPR Article 17: Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
 * - GDPR Article 5: Principles of processing
 * - GDPR Article 6: Lawfulness of processing
 * - CCPA Section 1798.120: Right to opt-out of sale
 * - CCPA Section 1798.115: Right to delete
 * - CCPA Section 1798.110: Right to know
 * 
 * Compliance Patterns:
 * - Proper deletion mechanisms with authorization
 * - Consent-based data processing
 * - Purpose-limited data collection
 * - Data subject rights implementation
 * - Appropriate data retention policies
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This rule scans for patterns that may violate privacy regulations and
 * provides guidance on how to implement compliant data handling practices.
 * It helps ensure that applications respect user privacy rights.
