 * Rule - Base Interface for Privacy Violation Detection Rules
 * 
 * This file defines the base interface and types for all privacy violation detection rules
 * in the Privacy Vulnerabilities Checker. It provides the foundational structure that
 * all specific privacy rules must implement.
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * - Rule interface: Base contract for all privacy rules
 * - Violation interface: Structure for detected privacy violations
 * - PatternRule interface: Extended interface for pattern-based rules
 * - Common types and utilities for rule implementation
 * 
 * Interface Features:
 * - Standardized rule structure for consistency
 * - Violation reporting format
 * - Pattern matching capabilities
 * - Suppression and marker support
 * - Extensible design for new rule types
 * 
 * Usage:
 * All privacy rules extend this base interface to ensure consistent
 * behavior and reporting across the entire rule engine. This provides
 * a unified approach to privacy violation detection and reporting.
