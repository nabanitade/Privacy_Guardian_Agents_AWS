 * RuleEngine - Core Privacy Scanning Engine
 * 
 * The RuleEngine is the central orchestrator of Privacy Guardian Agents's privacy violation detection system.
 * It manages a collection of privacy rules and scanners to provide comprehensive privacy compliance
 * analysis across multiple programming languages and file types.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Orchestrates 10+ privacy rule engines for comprehensive violation detection
 * - Manages multi-language scanners for 12+ programming languages
 * - Provides hybrid AI + hardcoded rule scanning capabilities
 * - Implements robust fallback mechanisms for reliability
 * - Offers configurable scanning modes and rule management
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Rule-based detection using pattern matching and validation
 * - AI-enhanced analysis via Google Gemini (optional)
 * - Multi-language support through specialized scanners
 * - Hybrid approach combining traditional and AI-powered detection
 * 
 * Rule Types Managed:
 * - PII Detection: Email addresses, SSN, credit cards, phone numbers
 * - Privacy Policy: GDPR/CCPA compliance violations
 * - Consent Management: Explicit consent marker validation
 * - Encryption & Security: Data protection and encryption checks
 * - Data Flow: Sensitive data handling and retention
 * - Advanced Privacy: Complex data-flow and context-aware violations
 * - AI-Powered: Intelligent analysis and explanations
 * - Developer Guidance: Real-time privacy impact assessment
 * 
 * Supported Languages:
 * - JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Go, C#
 * - PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Rust, Scala
 * 
 * Configuration Options:
 * - GEMINI_ENABLED: Enable/disable AI scanning
 * - HARDCODED_RULES_ENABLED: Enable/disable hardcoded rules
 * - GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT: Vertex AI project configuration
 * - GEMINI_API_KEY: Google AI API key for direct access
 * 
 * Usage:
 * The RuleEngine processes code files through multiple rule engines,
 * combining traditional pattern-based detection with AI-powered analysis
 * to provide comprehensive privacy violation detection and remediation guidance.
 * 
 * Fallback System:
 * - Always runs hardcoded rules regardless of AI availability
 * - Gracefully falls back when AI services are unavailable
 * - Provides consistent results across different environments
 * - Maintains reliability in production deployments
