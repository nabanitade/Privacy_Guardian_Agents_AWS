ComplianceAgent - Regulatory Compliance Analysis and Mapping
============================================================

This agent is responsible for analyzing privacy violations against regulatory frameworks
and providing compliance scoring. It listens for AIEnhancedFindings events from
BedrockAnalysisAgent and emits ComplianceAnalysisCompleted events for downstream agents.

Key Responsibilities:
--------------------
- Listen for AIEnhancedFindings events from BedrockAnalysisAgent
- Map privacy violations to regulatory frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Calculate compliance scores and risk assessments
- Provide detailed regulatory analysis and gap identification
- Generate compliance recommendations and action items
- Emit ComplianceAnalysisCompleted events with analysis results

Event-Based Architecture:
------------------------
This agent is the third in the event flow chain:
- Listens for AIEnhancedFindings events from BedrockAnalysisAgent
- Performs regulatory compliance analysis
- Emits ComplianceAnalysisCompleted events with analysis results
- Provides compliance scoring for downstream processing

Regulatory Frameworks Supported:
-------------------------------
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):
- Data processing principles and legal basis
- Individual rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
- Consent requirements and data minimization
- Cross-border data transfers and breach notification
- Data Protection Officer (DPO) requirements

CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):
- Consumer rights and disclosure requirements
- Data sale opt-out mechanisms
- Service provider restrictions
- Financial incentive programs
- Right to know and deletion requests

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):
- Protected Health Information (PHI) safeguards
- Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- Privacy rule compliance and patient rights
- Security rule implementation
- Breach notification requirements

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):
- Cardholder data protection requirements
- Network security and access control
- Vulnerability management and monitoring
- Information security policy
- Regular security testing and assessment

Compliance Analysis Capabilities:
-------------------------------
Violation Mapping:
- Maps each violation to applicable regulations
- Identifies specific regulatory requirements violated
- Provides detailed compliance gap analysis
- Assesses severity of regulatory violations

Compliance Scoring:
- Calculates overall compliance score (0-100)
- Provides regulation-specific compliance percentages
- Identifies critical compliance gaps
- Prioritizes compliance improvements

Risk Assessment:
- Evaluates regulatory risk levels
- Assesses potential fines and penalties
- Identifies reputational and legal risks
- Provides risk mitigation strategies

Processing Flow:
---------------
1. Listen for AIEnhancedFindings event from BedrockAnalysisAgent
2. Convert enhanced results to ScanResult objects if needed
3. Map violations to regulatory frameworks
4. Calculate compliance scores and risk assessments
5. Generate compliance recommendations
6. Emit ComplianceAnalysisCompleted event with analysis results

AI Integration:
--------------
When Bedrock AI is available:
- Enhances compliance analysis with AI insights
- Provides context-aware regulatory interpretation
- Identifies emerging compliance trends
- Generates strategic compliance recommendations

Fallback Mechanisms:
-------------------
- Uses hardcoded regulatory mapping when AI is unavailable
- Maintains comprehensive compliance coverage
- Provides reliable compliance scoring and analysis

Integration Points:
------------------
- BedrockAnalysisAgent: Receives AIEnhancedFindings events
- Google Bedrock AI: Enhanced compliance analysis
- FixSuggestionAgent: Emits ComplianceAnalysisCompleted for fix suggestions
- Event System: Listens for and emits events

Usage:
------
The agent is typically invoked by the Agent Orchestrator after BedrockAnalysisAgent:
- enhanced_results: AI-enhanced results from BedrockAnalysisAgent
- correlation_id: Request tracking ID
- compliance_options: Optional compliance configuration

Returns:
- Comprehensive compliance analysis report
- Regulatory mapping and compliance scores
- Risk assessment and recommendations

Event Communication:
-------------------
Listens for:
- AIEnhancedFindings: Enhanced results from BedrockAnalysisAgent

Emits:
- ComplianceAnalysisCompleted: Compliance analysis results
- ComplianceAnalysisStarted: When analysis begins

Dependencies:
-------------
- Google Bedrock AI: Enhanced compliance analysis
- BedrockAnalysisAgent: Source of AIEnhancedFindings events
- asyncio: Asynchronous processing
- json: Data serialization and parsing
- datetime: Timestamp management
- typing: Type hints and data structures

    Agent responsible for regulatory compliance mapping and severity classification.
    
    This agent analyzes privacy violations and maps them to specific regulatory
    requirements, providing comprehensive compliance analysis for GDPR, CCPA,
    HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other privacy regulations. It combines hardcoded
    regulation mappings with AI-enhanced insights when Bedrock is available.
    
    Key Features:
    - Comprehensive regulatory mapping for 50+ violation types
    - AI-enhanced compliance analysis with business impact assessment
    - Risk quantification and strategic recommendations
    - Implementation timeline and resource planning
    - Robust fallback to hardcoded rules when AI is unavailable
    
    Processing Flow:
    1. Receive scan results from PrivacyScanAgent
    2. Map each violation to applicable regulations
    3. Calculate compliance scores and risk assessments
    4. Generate strategic recommendations
    5. Provide implementation timeline and action plans
    
    AI Enhancement:
    - Dynamic compliance assessment based on business context
    - Enhanced risk analysis with financial and reputational impact
    - Strategic compliance planning with resource requirements
    - Implementation timeline optimization
    - Business impact quantification

    Integrations:
    - Inserts compliance analytics into BigQuery after analysis
    - Exports compliance metrics to Cloud Monitoring
    - Fetches secrets (e.g., compliance config) from Secret Manager
    - Cloud Function trigger template provided for serverless execution
