ReportAgent - Comprehensive Privacy Audit Report Generation
==========================================================

This agent is responsible for generating comprehensive privacy audit reports
by aggregating all previous agent outputs. It listens for FixSuggestionsCompleted
events from FixSuggestionAgent and emits ReportGenerated events with final reports.

Key Responsibilities:
--------------------
- Listen for FixSuggestionsCompleted events from FixSuggestionAgent
- Aggregate all previous agent outputs (scan results, compliance analysis, fix suggestions)
- Generate comprehensive privacy audit reports
- Provide executive summaries and detailed findings
- Store reports in Google Cloud Storage or Firestore
- Emit ReportGenerated events with final reports and storage locations

Event-Based Architecture:
------------------------
This agent is the final step in the event flow chain:
- Listens for FixSuggestionsCompleted events from FixSuggestionAgent
- Aggregates all previous agent outputs
- Generates comprehensive privacy audit reports
- Emits ReportGenerated events with final reports

Report Generation Capabilities:
------------------------------
Executive Summary:
- High-level privacy posture assessment
- Key findings and risk levels
- Compliance scores and status
- Strategic recommendations

Detailed Findings:
- Comprehensive violation analysis
- File-by-file breakdown of issues
- Severity assessment and prioritization
- Technical details and context

Compliance Analysis:
- Regulatory framework mapping
- Compliance gap identification
- Risk assessment and quantification
- Legal and business implications

Fix Recommendations:
- Prioritized action items
- Implementation guidance and timeline
- Resource requirements and effort estimates
- Success criteria and validation

Risk Assessment:
- Overall risk level determination
- Financial and reputational impact
- Compliance and regulatory risks
- Mitigation strategies and recommendations

Processing Flow:
---------------
1. Listen for FixSuggestionsCompleted event from FixSuggestionAgent
2. Aggregate all previous agent outputs (scan results, compliance analysis, fix suggestions)
3. Generate comprehensive privacy audit report
4. Store report in Google Cloud Storage or Firestore
5. Emit ReportGenerated event with final report and storage location

AI Integration:
--------------
When Bedrock AI is available:
- Enhances report generation with AI insights
- Provides business impact analysis
- Generates strategic recommendations
- Improves report clarity and actionability

Fallback Mechanisms:
-------------------
- Uses hardcoded report templates when AI is unavailable
- Maintains comprehensive report coverage
- Provides reliable report generation capabilities

Integration Points:
------------------
- FixSuggestionAgent: Receives FixSuggestionsCompleted events
- Google Bedrock AI: Enhanced report generation
- Google Cloud Storage: Report storage and retrieval
- Event System: Listens for and emits events

Usage:
------
The agent is typically invoked by the Agent Orchestrator after FixSuggestionAgent:
- enhanced_results: AI-enhanced results from previous agents
- compliance_report: Compliance analysis from ComplianceAgent
- fix_suggestions: Fix recommendations from FixSuggestionAgent
- correlation_id: Request tracking ID
- report_options: Optional report configuration

Returns:
- Comprehensive privacy audit report
- Executive summary and detailed findings
- Compliance analysis and risk assessment
- Fix recommendations and action items
- Report storage location

Event Communication:
-------------------
Listens for:
- FixSuggestionsCompleted: Fix suggestions from FixSuggestionAgent

Emits:
- ReportGenerated: Final comprehensive report
- ReportGenerationStarted: When report generation begins

Dependencies:
-------------
- Google Bedrock AI: Enhanced report generation
- FixSuggestionAgent: Source of FixSuggestionsCompleted events
- Google Cloud Storage: Report storage and retrieval
- asyncio: Asynchronous processing
- json: Data serialization and parsing
- datetime: Timestamp management
- typing: Type hints and data structures

Author: Privacy Guardian Team
Built with Google Cloud Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Integrations:
- Inserts report analytics into BigQuery after report generation
- Exports report metrics to Cloud Monitoring
- Fetches secrets (e.g., report config) from Secret Manager
- Cloud Function trigger template provided for serverless execution
