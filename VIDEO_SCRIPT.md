## **0:00 - 0:30 (30 seconds) - Introduction & Problem**

### **Visual Elements:**
- [Screen recording starts]
- Show the project title: "Privacy Guardian Agents"
- Display the problem statement with animated text

### **Narration:**
*"Privacy violations cost companies $2.7 billion in fines last year alone. Traditional privacy scanning tools are manual, slow, and often miss critical issues. Today, I'm demonstrating Privacy Guardian Agents - a revolutionary multi-agent AI system built with AWS Lambda that transforms privacy compliance from a weeks-long manual process into a 3-minute automated workflow."*

Privacy Guardian Agents

The Problem:
• $2.7B in GDPR fines (2023)
• Manual privacy reviews take weeks
• Traditional tools lack context awareness
• Reactive privacy management
```

## **0:30 - 1:00 (30 seconds) - Architecture Overview**

### **Visual Elements:**
- Show the architecture diagram
- Highlight AWS Lambda as the core service
- Animate the flow between agents

### **Narration:**
*"Our solution uses AWS Lambda as the core serverless compute service, orchestrating five specialized AI agents through an event-driven architecture. Each agent is a Lambda function that communicates via AWS EventBridge, with results stored in S3 and DynamoDB. AWS Bedrock provides AI intelligence, while Step Functions coordinate the entire workflow."*

## **1:00 - 1:45 (45 seconds) - Live Demo**

### **Visual Elements:**
- Open terminal/command line
- Show the deployment script running
- Demonstrate the API call
- Show real-time agent processing

### **Narration:**
*"Let me show you how this works in practice. First, I'll deploy the system using AWS SAM. Notice how each Lambda function is automatically created with the right permissions and event triggers. Now, I'll initiate a privacy scan of a Java codebase containing multiple violations."*

### **Commands to Show:**
```bash
# Deploy the system
./deploy_aws.sh development

# Test the API
curl -X POST https://your-api-gateway-url/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_path": "tests/aws-test/test_violations.java",
    "scan_id": "demo-scan-001"
  }'
```

### **On-Screen Text:**
```
🚀 Deploying to AWS...
✅ 5 Lambda functions created
✅ API Gateway configured
✅ EventBridge bus set up
✅ S3 bucket created
✅ DynamoDB table created

🔍 Initiating Privacy Scan...
📊 Scanning for 50+ violation types

## **1:45 - 2:30 (45 seconds) - Results & AI Analysis**

### **Visual Elements:**
- Show the scan results appearing in real-time
- Display the violations found
- Show AWS Bedrock analysis
- Display compliance mapping

### **Narration:**
*"The PrivacyScanAgent found 5 critical violations including hardcoded secrets, insecure connections, and sensitive data logging. The BedrockAnalysisAgent then provides context-aware AI analysis, understanding that this isn't just about finding violations, but assessing business risk. The ComplianceAgent maps these to GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS regulations, calculating potential fines of over $2 million."*

### **On-Screen Text:**
```
🔍 Scan Results:
✅ 5 violations found
• HardcodedSecret (CRITICAL)
• InsecureConnection (HIGH)
• HardcodedEmail (HIGH)
• LoggingSensitiveData (HIGH)
• HardcodedSSN (CRITICAL)

🤖 AI Analysis:
• Context-aware risk assessment
• Business impact evaluation
• Strategic recommendations

⚖️ Compliance Mapping:
• GDPR: €20M potential fine
• CCPA: $7,500 per violation
• HIPAA: $50K per violation
• PCI DSS: $100K per month
```
